# New Cartoons

An iOS app built with Swift and UIKit that displays information about new (Western) animated series being released in the current year. The app uses the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) to get the list of cartoons to be displayed.

There are plenty of alternatives for anime already (such as [Anichart](https://anichart.net/Winter-2022)), so I thought I'd make something for Western cartoons.

Work in progress.
